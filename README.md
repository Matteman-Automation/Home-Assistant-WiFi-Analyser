# Home Assistant WiFi Analyser

## Check your WiFi signal 24/7 and send it by using MQTT to Home Assistant

Wifi at our home or office is very important nowadays. If you have kids or work with a laptop WiFi you canâ€™t without. 
- But when do you have a good WiFi signal and when not? 
- Where do you have a good WiFi signal and where does it need some improvement?
Yep, this was also my problem and running Home Assistant with some sensors on WiFi I need to know more about my WiFi network at home.
So, I got to the drawing board and created a simple device to monitor my WiFi Signal 24/7 and have a nice graphical display in Home Assistant.

### What did I use?
The only thing I really needed was a ESP8266 board and an USB power supply (with cable). Yep, I have used an D1 mini board, a small display and printed a nice housing, but only the ESP8266 board is enough.
You can find the code here on my GitHub Repositorie. It is easy to use, like plug and play.
What did I use for this project:
- Wemos D1 Mini
- Blue I2C OLED Display
- some wires 
and a 3d printed housing grom Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2884823
